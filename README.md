# Music-Player-Application-in-Python
The music player application allows users to select a directory containing MP3 files, play, pause, stop, and navigate through the songs in the directory.
The code uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface and Pygame for audio playback. The mutagen.id3 library is used to extract song titles from the MP3 files.
